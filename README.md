# Getting a GoodNight Sleep

Sleep is a foundational driver of physical recovery, cognitive performance, and long-term health. High-quality sleep supports cellular repair, immune function, emotional regulation, and memory consolidation, while chronic poor sleep is linked to elevated stress, reduced productivity, and increased risk of illness. Despite its importance, sleep outcomes vary widely across individuals due to differences in lifestyle, work patterns, and underlying health conditions.

In this project,SleepInc has shared anonymized, six-month average data from its SleepScope app for 374 individuals.The dataset includes sleep duration and sleep quality ratings alongside lifestyle and health indicators such as physical activity,daily steps,stress level, BMI category,resting heart rate,blood pressure,occupation,gender,age and reported sleep disorders.

Business Objective

The goal is to uncover actionable relationships between lifestyle factors and sleep outcomes—specifically:
Which factors are most strongly associated with sleep quality and sleep duration, and
How these relationships vary across key user segments, particularly exercise behavior (activity minutes/steps), gender, and occupation.

These insights will help SleepInc:
Identify high-impact levers (e.g., activity and stress) that can be targeted through coaching, nudges, or in-app recommendations.
Define user segments that may need differentiated experiences (e.g., occupation-driven stress profiles).
Inform product experimentation and personalization strategies to improve sleep outcomes at scale.

Analytical Approach 
this analysis inlcudes the below steps:

Data cleaning and feature engineering (eg: parsing blood pressure into systolic/diastolic)
Descriptive profiling of sleep outcomes across demographics and occupations.
Relationship analysis between physical activity (minutes/day and steps) and sleep quality/duration using comparisons and visual diagnostics.
Segmented analysis by gender and occupation to detect meaningful differences.
Adjusted modeling to separate direct relationships (e.g., activity → sleep quality) from confounders such as stress, BMI category, age, and sleep disorder status.
